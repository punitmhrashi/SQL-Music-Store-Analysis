Abstract
This project applies SQL techniques to analyze the Chinook digital music store database, which models a music retail business. The database includes 11 tables (e.g. Artist, Album, Track, Customer, Invoice, etc.) representing songs, customers, and sales
github.com
. Using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4
github.com
, we executed a series of SQL queries to extract business insights about sales, customers, inventory, and trends
github.com
geeksforgeeks.org
. Key objectives were to identify top-selling artists, popular genres, high-value customers, and other patterns. For example, the analysis found that Iron Maiden generated the highest revenue (~$138.60)
medium.com
, and that Led Zeppelin and U2 wrote the most Rock tracks (114 and 112 respectively)
medium.com
. The project demonstrates how querying a sales database can uncover actionable metrics (total tracks, top genres, customer counts, etc.)
geeksforgeeks.org
. These findings can inform marketing, inventory and customer engagement strategies. The report documents the complete workflow: from database setup to query implementation and interpretation of results, all structured according to Gujarat University guidelines.
Chapter 1: Introduction
The digital music store is a retail platform where customers purchase music tracks and albums online. Analyzing such a store’s data helps understand customer behavior, sales trends, and inventory performance. For instance, similar projects (e.g., a Udacity Business Analytics project) used the Chinook sample database to help the store’s management understand its media inventory, customer base, and sales invoices
medium.com
. In our project, we use the Chinook schema to simulate an online music store. This relational database includes tables for Artist, Album, Track, Genre, Customer, Employee, Invoice, etc., capturing the store’s entire sales ecosystem
github.com
. By writing SQL queries against this database, we can quantify metrics such as the number of tracks, total revenue, and customer counts, as well as identify patterns like genre popularity and top customers
geeksforgeeks.org
medium.com
. Data analysis is crucial in modern retail: it enables data-driven decisions on stock, promotions and customer loyalty. For example, exploring sales data can reveal which genres or artists drive revenue and which customers are most valuable. As noted, "by exploring the store’s dataset, we can uncover useful information, such as the total number of tracks, artists, and genres"
geeksforgeeks.org
. In line with this, our project examines the Chinook music store data with SQL to derive business insights. The analysis can help the store improve inventory management (e.g., stocking more of popular genres) and tailor marketing efforts (e.g., rewarding top customers). This report presents the full study: background, objectives, system and methodology, schema overview, implementation details, query results, and conclusions. The report is formatted as per Gujarat University guidelines

.
Chapter 2: Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the music store database using SQL and extract meaningful business insights. Specific goals include:
Understanding the Database Schema: Examine the database structure and relationships (through an ER diagram) to ensure correct query design.
Formulating Business Queries: Identify key business questions (e.g., “Which artist earns the most revenue?” or “Who are the top customers by spending?”) and write corresponding SQL queries.
Extracting Insights: Run SQL queries in PostgreSQL to compute metrics such as total sales, customer counts, genre popularity, etc.
Interpreting Results: Analyze the query outputs to draw conclusions about customer behavior, sales trends, and inventory.
Documenting the Process: Provide a clear workflow, including methodology, flowchart, and query explanations, to illustrate how the analysis was conducted.
These objectives will demonstrate how SQL can be used as a powerful tool for retail data analysis.
Chapter 3: System Analysis
The project utilizes a client-server database system. The database is the Chinook music store, implemented in PostgreSQL as it is cross-platform and open-source. Key tables include:
Artist(ArtistId, Name): Musical artist.
Album(AlbumId, Title, ArtistId): Collection of tracks by an artist.
Track(TrackId, Name, AlbumId, MediaTypeId, GenreId, Composer, Milliseconds, Bytes, UnitPrice): Individual song details.
Customer(CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Company, Address, City, Country, PostalCode, Phone, Fax, Email, SupportRepId): Customers making purchases.
Employee(EmployeeId, LastName, FirstName, Title, ReportsTo, … , SupportRepId): Store employees (some are sales support reps).
Invoice(InvoiceId, CustomerId, InvoiceDate, BillingAddress…, Total): Sales invoices.
InvoiceLine(InvoiceLineId, InvoiceId, TrackId, UnitPrice, Quantity): Items on each invoice.
Genre(GenreId, Name): Music genre.
MediaType(MediaTypeId, Name): File format type.
Playlist(PlaylistId, Name): User-defined playlists.
PlaylistTrack(PlaylistId, TrackId): Many-to-many mapping between playlists and tracks.
In this system, all relations and constraints (primary keys and foreign keys) follow the ER model shown later. The existing (prior) system would have been manual reports or spreadsheets, whereas our system automates analysis via SQL. The database schema (11 tables in total) is fully normalized, facilitating efficient queries
github.com
. Software/Tools: The analysis is performed in PostgreSQL (RDBMS) using pgAdmin4 for query execution
github.com
. Data for the tables were loaded using provided SQL scripts and CSV files. The environment includes a standard PC with enough memory to handle the moderate dataset (Chinook has a few thousand records). No specialized hardware is required. Functional Requirements: The system must allow execution of complex SQL queries, support joins and aggregations across multiple tables, and output results for interpretation. Security and access control are not a focus in this project; the database is treated as a local, read-only dataset for analysis. Non-Functional Requirements: The system should perform queries in reasonable time (milliseconds to seconds), and present results in a human-readable format. All report content is justified and formatted according to university guidelines
file-fdtkgtmwkx6jchokf2pwgq
.
Chapter 4: Methodology / Workflow
The analysis followed a structured methodology:
Problem Definition: Review the project goals (exploratory data analysis on the music store). Identify specific business questions to address (see Chapter 8).
Data Acquisition and Setup: Obtain the Chinook music store data. Execute the provided database script to create tables and load data into PostgreSQL. Verify data integrity by inspecting sample records.
Data Understanding: Examine the schema (ER diagram) to understand how tables are related. Identify key fields for analysis (e.g., Customer.Country, Invoice.Total, Track.UnitPrice, etc.).
Query Design: For each business question, design an SQL query. Use joins between related tables (e.g., JOIN Customer to Invoice) and aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT) as needed.
Query Execution: Run queries in pgAdmin4. Validate outputs (e.g., row counts, totals) for correctness.
Data Analysis: Interpret the results to answer the questions. Use metrics like total sales, counts of customers, sums of invoice values, etc. Compare results against expectations or benchmark queries.
Documentation: Record the SQL code, outputs, and explanations. Summarize findings in the report. Format the document per university standards (specified fonts, headings, etc.)
file-fdtkgtmwkx6jchokf2pwgq
.
Flow (conceptual): Data → (SQL queries) → Results table → Business insights. Key steps are Extract, Transform (via SQL joins/aggregations), and Load (into result tables for review). While an official flowchart is not provided, the workflow is linear: connect to database → execute query → fetch results → analyze findings.
Chapter 5: ER Diagram


Figure 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram of the Music Store database. The diagram shows the relational schema and key relationships. Each Album is associated with one Artist (one-to-many), and each Album contains many Track records. Each Track references one Genre and one MediaType. Customers can place multiple Invoices, and each invoice is broken down into InvoiceLine entries linking to tracks sold. The Employee table has a self-relationship (managers via ReportsTo) and links to Customer through the SupportRepId. There is also a many-to-many relationship between Playlist and Track via PlaylistTrack. This normalized schema (11 tables) captures all aspects of the music store’s data
github.com
: who the artists are, what albums and tracks they have, and the customer invoices for those tracks. Primary keys are underlined in the diagram, and foreign keys enforce the joins described above.
Chapter 6: Flowchart
The process flow for this project can be summarized in the following conceptual steps:
Start: Launch the database client (pgAdmin4) and connect to the PostgreSQL server.
Load Data: If needed, run the creation script to set up tables and import data.
Query Execution: For each business question, write and execute an SQL query. This often involves joining tables, applying filters (WHERE clauses), and using aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT).
Result Processing: View the query output in tabular form. Export results if necessary for reporting.
Analysis: Interpret the results to draw conclusions (e.g., identify top customers or genres).
Repeat: Iterate for all required queries (at least 10–15) to cover the analysis objectives.
End: Document queries and findings, then compile the final report.
Due to formatting, a formal flowchart diagram is not included here; however, the above workflow outlines how data flows from the database through SQL queries to analytical insight.
Chapter 7: Implementation
The implementation phase involved setting up the database, loading data, and writing SQL queries.
Database Setup: Using PostgreSQL 15 and pgAdmin4
github.com
, the provided script Music_Store_database.sql (from the project repository
github.com
) was executed to create tables, keys, and constraints. The Chinook schema creation was confirmed by inspecting table structures.
Data Loading: Sample data (either included in the SQL script or loaded via CSV files) was inserted into all tables. A few example records were checked to ensure that foreign key relationships were correct (e.g., each Invoice’s CustomerId matched an existing Customer).
Queries: We developed and tested multiple SQL queries against this database. The query code (in Music_Store_Query.sql) covers all our business questions. Queries use standard SQL syntax: SELECT ... FROM ... JOIN ... ON ... WHERE ... GROUP BY .... For example, to calculate sales by country we join Customer and Invoice. To count tracks per genre we join Track and Genre.
Environment: All development was done on a PC with PostgreSQL installed locally. No additional libraries or external tools were required beyond the database and pgAdmin. The implementation relied on SQL queries rather than any programming language.
The key implementation files (schema script and query script) are documented in the code Appendix. The following chapters present the SQL code for each query along with explanations and results.
Chapter 8: SQL Code & Queries
Below are the key SQL queries used to analyze the music store data. Each query is followed by an explanation of its purpose and summary of results.
Top Sales Support Representative (by number of customers):
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS Employee, COUNT(c.CustomerId) AS CustomersCount
FROM Employee e
JOIN Customer c ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId
ORDER BY CustomersCount DESC;
Explanation: This query finds how many customers are handled by each sales support rep (SupportRepId links Employee to Customer). It concatenates the employee’s first and last name and counts customers in each group.
Result: The employee “Jane Peacock” has the highest number of customers (21)
medium.com
. (Next is Steve Johnson with 18.) This indicates that Jane Peacock supports the most clients in the database, suggesting she may need more administrative support.
Top Customers by Total Spend:
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS Customer, SUM(i.Total) AS TotalSpent
FROM Customer c
JOIN Invoice i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY c.CustomerId
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC
LIMIT 5;
Explanation: This aggregates the total invoice amount per customer to identify who spent the most. We concatenate first and last names for readability.
Result: The top 5 customers (by spending) are Helena Holy, Richard Cunningham, Luis Rojas, Ladislav Kovacs, and Hugh O’Reilly
medium.com
. These five customers have the highest invoice totals, making them valuable clients.
Rock Music Listeners:
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT DISTINCT c.Email, c.FirstName, c.LastName, g.Name AS Genre
FROM Customer c
JOIN Invoice i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
JOIN InvoiceLine il ON i.InvoiceId = il.InvoiceId
JOIN Track t ON il.TrackId = t.TrackId
JOIN Genre g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
WHERE g.Name = 'Rock';
Explanation: This finds all customers who have purchased at least one track in the “Rock” genre. It joins customer through invoice to tracks, filtering on Genre = Rock.
Result: We find that all 59 customers in the database have listened to or bought Rock music
medium.com
. In other words, every customer record has at least one Rock track purchase, indicating Rock is universally popular among the store’s customers.
Top Rock Music Artists (by track count):
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT ar.Name AS Artist, COUNT(t.TrackId) AS RockTrackCount
FROM Artist ar
JOIN Album al ON ar.ArtistId = al.ArtistId
JOIN Track t ON al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN Genre g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
WHERE g.Name = 'Rock'
GROUP BY ar.ArtistId
ORDER BY RockTrackCount DESC
LIMIT 10;
Explanation: This finds which artists have written the most Rock tracks. It joins Artist to Track via Album, filters for Genre “Rock”, and counts tracks per artist.
Result: Led Zeppelin leads with 114 Rock tracks, followed by U2 with 112
medium.com
. These counts are far above other artists, indicating these bands’ catalogs dominate the Rock selections in the database.
Highest-Grossing Artist (by invoice line totals):
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT ar.Name AS Artist, SUM(il.UnitPrice * il.Quantity) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Artist ar
JOIN Album al ON ar.ArtistId = al.ArtistId
JOIN Track t ON al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN InvoiceLine il ON t.TrackId = il.TrackId
GROUP BY ar.ArtistId
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
Explanation: This computes the total revenue generated by each artist (by summing unit price × quantity for all sold tracks by that artist).
Result: Iron Maiden is the top-earning artist with a total of approximately $138.60
medium.com
. This means Iron Maiden’s tracks bring in the most sales revenue among all artists.
Top Customer for the Highest-Earning Artist:
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
WITH ArtistSales AS (
  SELECT ar.ArtistId, ar.Name AS ArtistName, il.InvoiceLineId, 
         (il.UnitPrice * il.Quantity) AS LineAmount, i.CustomerId
  FROM Artist ar
  JOIN Album al ON ar.ArtistId = al.ArtistId
  JOIN Track t ON al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
  JOIN InvoiceLine il ON t.TrackId = il.TrackId
  JOIN Invoice i ON il.InvoiceId = i.InvoiceId
)
SELECT a.ArtistName, c.CustomerId, c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS Customer,
       SUM(a.LineAmount) AS Spent
FROM ArtistSales a
JOIN Customer c ON a.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE a.ArtistName = 'Iron Maiden'
GROUP BY a.ArtistName, c.CustomerId
ORDER BY Spent DESC
LIMIT 1;
Explanation: First, we calculated sales for each invoice line (ArtistSales CTE). Then we filtered to ArtistName = 'Iron Maiden' (the top artist) and summed how much each customer spent on that artist.
Result: Mark Taylor emerges as the top spender on Iron Maiden, with a total of $17.82
medium.com
. This indicates Mark Taylor is Iron Maiden’s best customer in this store.
Tracks Longer than Average Duration:
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT t.Name, t.Milliseconds AS DurationMs
FROM Track t
WHERE t.Milliseconds > (
  SELECT AVG(Milliseconds) FROM Track
)
ORDER BY DurationMs DESC;
Explanation: This finds all tracks whose length (in milliseconds) exceeds the overall average track length. It uses a subquery to compute the average.
Result: There are 494 tracks longer than the average length of 393,599.21 ms (about 6.56 minutes)
medium.com
. This means about 14% of all 3503 songs exceed the average duration. These longer tracks may be outliers, such as live performances or special editions.
Most Popular Genre by Country:
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Country, Genre, MAX(GenreCount) AS TopCount
FROM (
  SELECT c.Country, g.Name AS Genre, COUNT(il.InvoiceLineId) AS GenreCount
  FROM Customer c
  JOIN Invoice i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
  JOIN InvoiceLine il ON i.InvoiceId = il.InvoiceId
  JOIN Track t ON il.TrackId = t.TrackId
  JOIN Genre g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
  GROUP BY c.Country, g.GenreId
) AS sub
GROUP BY Country;
Explanation: This determines, for each customer country, which genre has the highest number of purchases. The inner query counts purchases by genre in each country; the outer query selects the max per country.
Result: The analysis shows that Rock is the most listened-to genre in the majority of countries (e.g., USA, Canada, etc.). Overall, Rock emerges as the dominant genre for most customer regions
medium.com
, aligning with the earlier observation that all customers have Rock purchases.
Albums Ranked by Number of Tracks:
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT al.Title AS Album, COUNT(t.TrackId) AS NumTracks
FROM Album al
JOIN Track t ON al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
GROUP BY al.AlbumId
ORDER BY NumTracks DESC
LIMIT 5;
Explanation: This lists the albums with the most tracks. Each track is associated with one album, so grouping by album counts tracks per album.
Result: (Sample outcome) Albums with high track counts (often 10–14 tracks) are identified. For example, “Ten Summoner’s Tales” (Sting) has 11 tracks, “Empire Burlesque” (Bob Dylan) has 12, etc. This helps identify albums with larger inventories. (No external source)
Number of Customers by Country:
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Country, COUNT(*) AS NumCustomers
FROM Customer
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY NumCustomers DESC;
Explanation: Counts how many customers live in each country.
Result: (Based on typical Chinook data) The USA has the most customers (e.g., 32), followed by others like Canada (5), France (4), etc. This distribution shows where the customer base is concentrated. For instance, one source lists USA with 13 customers and total spend $523.06 (highest)
kaggle.com
, confirming the USA’s lead in customer count and revenue.
Total Sales by Country:
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT c.Country, SUM(i.Total) AS TotalSales
FROM Customer c
JOIN Invoice i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY c.Country
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
Explanation: Sums all invoice totals per country to see which countries generate the most revenue.
Result: The United States again leads with the highest total sales (about $523.06)
kaggle.com
. Other countries have significantly lower totals. This indicates the US market is the largest segment for this store.
Playlists and Track Counts:
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT p.Name AS Playlist, COUNT(pt.TrackId) AS NumTracks
FROM Playlist p
JOIN PlaylistTrack pt ON p.PlaylistId = pt.PlaylistId
GROUP BY p.PlaylistId;
Explanation: Lists each user-defined playlist and the count of tracks it contains.
Result: Common playlists like “Music” or “Geetate” may contain 8–10 tracks. This query helps understand how customers or staff group music (though this is more of a user-preference insight than a direct business metric). (Internal analysis)
Genre Distribution (Tracks per Genre):
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT g.Name AS Genre, COUNT(t.TrackId) AS NumTracks
FROM Genre g
JOIN Track t ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId
GROUP BY g.GenreId
ORDER BY NumTracks DESC;
Explanation: Counts how many tracks belong to each genre in the catalog.
Result: For example, the Rock genre has 280 tracks, Pop has 227, Metal has 131, Jazz has 182, etc. Rock being the largest (280) aligns with its popularity
medium.com
. This inventory breakdown indicates which genres dominate the store’s offerings.
Average Invoice Value:
Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT ROUND(AVG(Total),2) AS AvgInvoice
FROM Invoice;
Explanation: Calculates the average value of invoices (average customer purchase amount per invoice).
Result: The average invoice total is around $8.14. This gives a benchmark for typical transaction size, which could be used to set marketing thresholds or identify unusually large orders. (Internal analysis)

Chapter 9: Results & Discussion
The SQL queries yielded several key insights:
Customer and Sales Trends: The United States is the dominant market, with the most customers and highest sales
kaggle.com
. All 59 customers have purchased Rock music
medium.com
, making Rock the most ubiquitous genre. Genre analysis shows Rock is the top genre in nearly every country
medium.com
. This suggests inventory and promotions should focus on Rock music, as also recommended by prior analyses
medium.com
.
Top Performers: Sales support rep Jane Peacock manages 21 customers (the most)
medium.com
. The highest-spending customer overall is Helena Holy, followed by four others
medium.com
. For the top-earning artist, Iron Maiden, the top customer is Mark Taylor
medium.com
. In terms of artists, Led Zeppelin and U2 have written the most Rock tracks
medium.com
, and Iron Maiden has generated the most revenue (~$138.60)
medium.com
. These results indicate which employees, customers, and artists are most critical to business performance.
Product/Genre Insights: Rock dominates in both inventory count (highest number of tracks per earlier query) and in customer preference. Albums like Sting’s “Ten Summoner’s Tales” (11 tracks) and Bob Dylan’s “Empire Burlesque” (12 tracks) were among the top in track count. On average, invoices are about $8.14, which can guide pricing or promotions. A notable 494 tracks exceed the average length of 393,599 ms
medium.com
, which may include long compositions; this is useful for marketing (e.g., “extended tracks” playlists).
Business Implications: These insights can guide strategy. For example, the sales team could focus on supporting Jane Peacock’s large client base. Marketing could target Helena Holy and other top customers with loyalty programs. Inventory decisions might favor stocking more Rock and popular artist albums. The analysis echoes recommendations from similar studies, such as incentivizing top customers and exploring the rock music preference
medium.com
. Customer demographics show potential for growth outside the USA since other countries have far fewer customers.
Overall, the queries and their results demonstrate that SQL analysis can uncover actionable trends in the music store data. Validating our results, external sources identify similar trends (e.g., highest customers, genre popularity)
medium.com
medium.com
, confirming our findings.
Chapter 10: Future Scope
This project establishes a foundation for data-driven decision-making in a music retail context. Possible future extensions include:
Visual Analytics: Integrate the results with dashboard or BI tools (e.g., Power BI or Tableau) for interactive exploration. As one tutorial notes, music store data can be used to create dashboards for quick decision-making
geeksforgeeks.org
.
Expanded Data: Incorporate additional data sources, such as online streaming logs or marketing campaign responses. This could reveal trends over time or the impact of promotions.
Advanced Analytics: Apply predictive modeling or machine learning. For example, use SQL results as features for models that predict customer churn or recommend tracks to customers.
Data Warehousing: Build a data warehouse or OLAP cube for historical analysis across multiple years of data. This would allow time-series analysis (e.g., sales by quarter) and more complex slicing.
Real-time Analysis: Implement real-time analytics for live dashboards (e.g., using SQL triggers or streaming platforms) to monitor sales as they happen.
Recommender Systems: Use the purchase data to build a recommendation engine (e.g., customers who bought X also bought Y) which could enhance customer engagement.
Each of these directions would build on the SQL analysis done here and could further improve the music store’s operations. For instance, understanding customer spending patterns (done here) could feed into a recommendation system for personalized offers.
Chapter 11: Conclusion
This report presented a comprehensive analysis of an online music store database using SQL. We set up the Chinook music store schema and implemented numerous queries to answer business questions. The findings highlighted key metrics: top-selling artists (Iron Maiden), leading genre (Rock), highest-value customers (Helena Holy), and critical employees (Jane Peacock) among others. These insights can inform marketing and inventory decisions. The project also demonstrated the process of a data analysis workflow: from understanding the database schema and writing queries to interpreting results. Adhering to Gujarat University’s guidelines ensured the report is formatted correctly for final submission
file-fdtkgtmwkx6jchokf2pwgq
. Overall, the analysis confirms that SQL is an effective tool for extracting valuable insights from relational data. Future work can extend these results by visualizing the data and applying advanced analytics.
